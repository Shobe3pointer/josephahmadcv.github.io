          <h2> About me </h2>
              <p>Hi, I am Shozab but everyone calls Joseph! Thanks for visiting my site, you have taken the first
                big step in looking for the right person for the tech role you've been wanting to fill.

                Previously, I had worked in financial data analytics and risk analysis, with my degree focusing in on
                these areas. However, as interesting as data analytics is, it didn't fuel my curiosity.
                From rabbit holes to dodgey data, data anlytics didn't seem right for me. Infact, I was more interested in the programming
                and query langauges being used. During my masters degree I gained even more exposure in coding through projects based on my degree,
                Complex Systems Modelling (I can promise you it's not as scary as it sounds). I spent my free time slowly learning
                the basics of SQL, Python and C++. The processes seemed so effortless, and once I understood one concept I tried to
                find ways to implement it elsewhere or to try more complex operations. Which brought me quite nicely to pursuing a
                career as a software developer. I see myself as being at the forefront of the tech world, wanting to stay ahead and
                keep up-to-date with the latest tech trends. Being a software developer, you never stop learning or discovering new
                concepts, and being the curious person I am, a career in software development will keep me asking questions and finding
                answers!

          <p>One thing I love doing is picking up new skills and hobbies. Over lockdown I took up wood-working and
          carpentry in an effort to make my own furniture and redevelop my home. Along the way I learnt new skills,
          brushed up some existing soft skills and built a small business making handmade pet furniture! To keep myself
          fit, I enjoy cross country, rowing and hiking.</p>
          <p>My goal by the end of the year is to complete the 3 peaks challenge
          by climbing the 3 tallest mountains in the country; Snowden, Scafell Pike and Ben Nevis.
          After this, I will set my sights on the 7 peaks challenge, climbing the tallest mountains in each continent across
          the world!</p>
          <p> When I am not building couches for kittens or running from Richmond to Romford, I can be found cooking up
          storms in the kitchen. I have been practising my culinary skills for the last 13 years, in that time I have grown even
          more confident in my technique, so much so that I am in the process of creating a YouTube channel to debut my culinary creations!

            <li>Over lockdown I decided to adopt two bunnies, Nico and Luna.
                I used my carpentry skills to build them a brand new room, toys and furniture.
                Despite tearing up the furniture and creating big messes around the house,
                they have been one of the best choices I have made in the last year!</li>
            <br>
            <li>During university I wanted to push myself in a new sport,
                so I decided to take up kick-boxing at a local dojo.
                The training was tough, and the (mis-matched) sparring was even tougher.
                But with hardwork, resilience and strong mentorship I reached the level of blue
                belt after 6 years!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sadly, I haven't been scuba-diving. Because of lockdown,
                all adventurous training with the army reserves had been cancelled.
                Which my deep sea dreams had to be dropped. However, there are still plenty of
                adventurous training courses for me to dive into. I have been presented with two wonderful opportunities,
                two of which include a ski instructor course and a static line jump course, both of which I intend to complete
                in the next year.
